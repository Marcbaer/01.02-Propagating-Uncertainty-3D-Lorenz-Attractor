# 01.02-Propagating-Uncertainty-3D-Lorenz-Attractor

This experiment evaluates GP-LSTM's (Gaussian Process regression in combination with LSTM's) on their ability to forecast the predictive distribution of dynamical systems.
The GP-LSTM models are built using the keras-gp library (https://github.com/alshedivat/keras-gp) with an octave engine.

Please check the [README_Lorenz_attractor File](README_Lorenz_attractor.docx) for detailed instructions on how to run the experiment.

*01.02 3-D Lorenz Attractor*

The predictive distributions of the GP-LSTM model are evaluated on the 3-Dimensional Lorenz Attracator.
